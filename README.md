## Overview of the statistical analysis
W. Avy wants more information about temperature trends before funding for opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu,Hawaii in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

### Determine the Summary Statistics for June and December months: 
* Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, we will filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June and also for December. 
* Then convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.

The summary statistics for the month of June and December is below:

## Analysis Results 
There are 1700 and 1517 temperature records, recorded for the month of June and December.
The average temperature is close for the month of June and December between 71 and 75 deg F.
The minimum and maximum temperatures are close for the month of June and December.
Hence we can say that the temperature fluctuations is very minimum throughout summer and winter. 
This is favorable for opening Surf n' Shake shop.
